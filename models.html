                                groundwater quality?</a>
                            <p>Water Quality Index (WQI) is a single numeric index that is used to measure the quality of water
                                in general, which includes complex mathematical calculation process. The advantage of using WQI over traditional reference methods is due to its reliable
                                and precise output. Traditional methods used in Sri Lanka is based on a cross reference method.
                                The parameter readings are obtained through sensors or other measurement methods and they are
                                cross referenced with the standard SLS (614:2013) approved chart to see whether the readings are
                                falling within an approved range.
                                <span id="dots">...</span>
                            </p>
                            <p id="readModel1">The contradiction comes in when one parameter falls within the approved range and the other
                                doesn’t. These type of scenarios pushes the identification process towards a subjective way where
                                people have to decide whether the water is suitable or not for usage, especially for drinking.
                            </p>
                            <p id="readModel2">On the other hand, WQI can be used to precisely state the quality of the water that is being tested.
                                All we have to do is compare the final numeric output (which is the WQI) and look for the class it
                                belongs to. The classes generally range from very poor to very good.
                            </p>
                            <p id="readModel3">The idea of using Water Quality Index in groundwater quality assessment comes in handy 
                                when it is incorporated with Artificial Intelligence techniques for a real time result acquiring 
                                process. Several regression algorithms have been trained and compared inorder to select the best one 
                                among them for the final implementation in the cloud. The end product displays the sensor readings 
                                along with the predicted WQI value and Suggestion methods to purify the water sample if needed.

                                economy. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant weight on the medical care
                                arrangement of Sri Lanka. Diabetes, hypertension, and the different types of
                                glomerulonephritis are very much perceived etiologies. With expanding predominance of
                                non-transferable maladies, specifically diabetes and hypertension, the weight of CKD is
                                relied upon to rise.5 Since the 1990s, another CKD, where no undeniable reason is
                                recognizable, has been depicted in Sri Lanka. This new condition has brought about an
                                ascent in the frequency of CKD in rustic Sri Lanka and has been suitably named ceaseless
                                kidney malady of obscure etiology (CKDu). Alternate proposed names for this condition
                                incorporate chronic agricultural nephropathy (CAN) and CKD of multifactorial origin
                                (CKD-mfo). Similar substances with obscure reason for CKD exist in different pieces of
                                the world. Ecological operators and conditions, for example, substantial metals and
                                modern synthetic concoctions, have been connected to the advancement of CKDu in
                                different pieces of the world.

                                and CKDu. Unawareness of quality of the consuming ground water is one of the major
                                causes for these scenarios. Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu) is one

                            <p id="readModel7">A smart intelligence device that has the capability to predict water quality is proposed to develop
                                a final year research project. It will be utilized to predict the water quality for the future and to
                                visualize the water quality sources based on the seasonal changes on the heat map. If forecasting
                                the water quality parameters of the groundwater are in the dry zone area, then it will favor for
                                people who are suffering from bad quality of water based on seasonal variation. Through this
                                system, the consumer will be alerted when the water goes under a low water quality index.
                                Therefore, they will be able to take better precautions for purifying water.
